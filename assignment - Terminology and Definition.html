        <h1>1. HTML Assignment: Terminology and Definitions</h1>
        <div>
            <p>
                <strong>1. <u>HTML & CSS:</u></strong> HTML is a programming language that stands for Hypertext Markup Language 
                This is a relatively simplistic yet powerful programming language that allows web developers and website 
                owners to create the structure of their websites. <br>

                CSS, stands for "Cascading Style Sheets" is a style sheet language thatâ€™s focused almost entirely on 
                improving the presentation of HTML elements. While CSS is a static programming language, it can be used 
                to make your website appear visually pleasing and modern.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>2. <u>HTML or CSS for putting paragraph of text on a webpage:</u></strong> HTML is used to structure 
                the content on the web page. CSS is used to add style to the content of a web page. Therefore without HTML I 
                wouldn't be able to add any text in any webpage. So, I would use HTML.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>3. <u>HTML or CSS for changing font and background color of button:</u></strong> We can't  change a 
                button's background color in HTML5 anymore, but we can use "font" tag and it's attributes "face", "size" and 
                "color" to change a button's font. An example is given below: 
                <div>
                    <button><font face="arial" size="3" color="blue">Click me</font></button>
                    Source Code: <'button><'font face="arial" size="3" color="blue">Click me<'/font><'/button> (ignore the 
                    single quotation marks)
                </div><br>
                But for styling HTML tags, using CSS is much more neat and reusable. We can also use "style" HTML attribute to 
                write CSS in a button tag and change it's background color and font.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>4. <u>HTML Tag:</u></strong> An HTML tag is a piece of markup language used to indicate the beginning 
                and end of an HTML element in an HTML document. As part of an HTML element, HTML tags help web browsers convert 
                HTML documents into web pages.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>5. <u>Three parts of an HTML elements:</u></strong> a start tag, some content, and an end tag.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>6. <u>Purpose of DOCTYPE declaration:</u></strong> The DOCTYPE declaration is an instruction to the 
                web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in. This ensures that the web page is parsed the 
                same way by different web browsers.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>7. <u>HTML Element:</u></strong> After we declare the doctype, we need to provide an "html" element. 
                This is what's known as the root element of the document, meaning that every other element in the document 
                will be a descendant of it
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>8. <u>Purpose of "head" element:</u></strong> The <head> element is where we put important 
                meta-information about our webpages, and stuff required for our webpages to render correctly in the browser. 
                Inside the "head", we should not use any element that displays content on the webpage.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>9. <u>Purpose of "body" element:</u></strong> The final element needed to complete the HTML boilerplate 
                is the "body" element. This is where all the content that will be displayed to users will go - the text, images, 
                lists, links, and so on.
            </p>

                <strong>13. <u>Make text bold and important:</u></strong> In HTML to mark text as both bold and important we 
                should use "strong" tag.
