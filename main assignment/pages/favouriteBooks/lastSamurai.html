        The Last Samurai (2000) is the first novel by American writer Helen DeWitt. It follows a single mother 
        and her young son, a child prodigy, who embarks on a quest to find his father. Despite selling well and 
        garnering critical acclaim on publication, it was out of print for almost a decade; when reissued in 2016, 
        it received renewed praise and accolades.
