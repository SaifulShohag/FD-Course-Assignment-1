        The Book Thief is a novel by the Australian author Markus Zusak, and is his most popular book. Published 
        in 2005, The Book Thief became an international bestseller and was translated into 63 languages and sold 
        16 million copies. It was adapted into the 2013 feature film, The Book Thief. The novel is about the 
        adventures of Liesel Meminger in Germany during a time of war. By personifying "Death" as a tangible 
        thing, the novel narrates a unique perspective into the world of the victims of the war.
