        The Kite Runner is the first novel by Afghan-American author Khaled Hosseini.[1] Published in 2003 by 
        Riverhead Books, it tells the story of Amir, a young boy from the Wazir Akbar Khan district of Kabul. 
        The story is set against a backdrop of tumultuous events, from the fall of Afghanistan's monarchy through 
        the Soviet invasion, the exodus of refugees to Pakistan and the United States, and the rise of the Taliban 
        regime.
