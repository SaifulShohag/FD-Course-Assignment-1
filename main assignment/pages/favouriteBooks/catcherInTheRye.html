        The Catcher in the Rye is a novel by J. D. Salinger, partially published in serial form in 1945â€“1946 and 
        as a novel in 1951. It was originally intended for adults, but is often read by adolescents for its themes 
        of angst, alienation, and as a critique of superficiality in society.[4][5] It has been translated widely.[6] 
        About one million copies are sold each year, with total sales of more than 65 million books.[7] The novel's 
        protagonist Holden Caulfield has become an icon for teenage rebellion.[8] The novel also deals with complex 
        issues of innocence, identity, belonging, loss, connection, sex, and depression.
