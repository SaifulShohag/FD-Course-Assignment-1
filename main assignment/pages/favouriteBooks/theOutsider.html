        The Outsiders is a coming-of-age novel by S. E. Hinton, first published in 1967 by Viking Press. Hinton 
        was 15 when she started writing the novel; however, she did most of the work when she was 16 and a junior 
        in high school.[1] Hinton was 18 when the book was published.[2] The book details the conflict between two 
        rival gangs divided by their socioeconomic status: the working-class "greasers" and the upper-class "Socs" 
        (pronounced /ˈsoʊʃɪz/—short for Socials). The story is told in first-person perspective by teenage 
        protagonist Ponyboy Curtis.
