        Edge of Tomorrow (retitled as Live. Die. Repeat.: Edge of Tomorrow on home media until 2022 where its 
        original title was restored)[4][5][nb 1] is a 2014 American science fiction action film starring Tom 
        Cruise, Emily Blunt, Bill Paxton, and Brendan Gleeson. Directed by Doug Liman with a screenplay written 
        by Christopher McQuarrie and the writing team of Jez and John-Henry Butterworth, its story is adapted 
        from the 2004 Japanese light novel All You Need Is Kill by Hiroshi Sakurazaka. The film takes place in a 
        future where most of Europe is occupied by an alien race. Major William Cage (Cruise), a public relations 
        officer with limited combat experience, is forced by his superiors to join a landing operation against the 
        aliens, only to find himself experiencing a time loop as he tries to find a way to defeat the invaders.
